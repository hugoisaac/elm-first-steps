  "body": "This repository contains my first attempts at using the Elm platform to build Web apps. I'm currently following the [Elm Guide](http://guide.elm-lang.org/) and putting what I learn into practice as a series of small examples found in the `src/` directory.\r\n\r\n## Run The Examples\r\n\r\n1. [Install Elm](http://elm-lang.org/install).\r\n2. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/hugoisaac/elm-first-steps.git`, or download and extract the `.zip` file.\r\n3. Open the compiled `.html` examples in the `dist/` directory, or run `elm-reactor` from the root directory to start a server at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) that will compile and run the `.elm` files from the `src/` directory.",
