# Elm First Steps

This repository contains my first attempts at using the Elm platform to build Web apps. I'm currently following the [Elm Guide](http://guide.elm-lang.org/) and putting what I learn into practice as a series of small examples found in the `src/` directory.

## Run The Examples

1. [Install Elm](http://elm-lang.org/install).
2. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/hugoisaac/elm-first-steps.git`.
3. Open the compiled `.html` examples in the `dist/` directory, or run `elm-reactor` from the root directory to start a server at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) that will compile and run the `.elm` files from the `src/` directory.
